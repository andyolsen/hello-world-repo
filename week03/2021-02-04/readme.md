# Topics

## Review Lab 8
* Show how to use collections inside classes
* Recap generic classes and methods

## Chapter 9 - Inheritance
* We covered the theory of slides 1 - 15 (you might like to read the slides themselves, there are a few extra examples) 

## Lab - Getting started with inheritance
* Write an abstract superclass named LibraryItem (a library item has a title and some kind of id-code).
* Write a subclass named Book. A Book is a kind of LibraryItem, with additional data (author, genre).
* Write a subclass named Film. A Film is a kind of LibraryItem, with additional data (director, rating, length).
* Write toString() functions in all the classes.
* Write some simple main() code to use your classes.
* Have a nice weekend :-)
