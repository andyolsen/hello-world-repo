# Modified files for Chapter 3 (Full Stack Development course materials)
What's changed:
* I've tweaked the PPT (in the "Autowiring" section, where it talks about constructor DI). The constructor is now public.
* In the demo, in the "demo.autowiring" package, I've made the BankServiceImpl constructor public. Also in application.properties, I've set the "name" property
